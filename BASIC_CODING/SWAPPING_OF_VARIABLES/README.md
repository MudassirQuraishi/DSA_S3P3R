# Variable Swapping Program

This Python program demonstrates how to swap the values of two variables, `a` and `b`, by interchanging them.

## Example

### Input

Let's say we have the following initial values:

- a = 3
- b = 4

### Output

After running the program, the values of `a` and `b` will be swapped, resulting in:

- a = 4
- b = 3
